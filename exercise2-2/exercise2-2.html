        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <div>
            <p>This exercise is challenging!</p>
            <p>In this exercise, create a wipe effect to transition from one image to another. You can see a few examples of wipes in the videos below.
            </p>
            <p>You can use the provided images, night-sky.jpg and blue-sky.jpg, or you can use your own 
                images. If you choose your own images, make sure they have the same dimensions. Make the 
                canvas the same size as the images.</p>
            <p>There are two main ways to approach this task:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Draw both images to the canvas as you did in the previous exercises. Create the wipe by selectively 
                    making pixels in the top image transparent (set the alpha to 0). OR...
                </li>
                <li>Only draw the start image on the canvas. Create the wipe by selectively replacing the R, G, B values of 
                    pixels in the start image with the values of the same pixels in the ending image.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>The first approach is slightly easier.</p>
            <p>The trickiest part of this exercise is figuring out how to translate the x, y coordinate of a pixel 
                you want to change to the relevant indices of its R, G, B, A values in the image's pixels array. Write 
                a function called <code>getIndexOfPixel()</code> that takes two parameters, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, 
                which represent the x and y coordinates of a pixel. The function should return the index of the 
                element in the pixel array that stores the pixel's red value. The function can assume that the image is the same width as 
                the canvas.
            </p>
            <p>The tests in check-exercise2-2.html will 
                check the output of this function for you. When your function is working properly, you can use it 
                to create your wipe effect. You will still need to figure out which pixels to change and how to change them.</p>
            <p>When you are finished, use <a href="check-exercise2-2.html">check-exercise2-2.html</a> to check your work.</p>
            <p>Expected output:</p>
            <p>The following are examples of wipes you could create. Feel free to do something different!</p>

                    <h3>Help with the <code>getIndexOfPixel()</code> function</h3>
                    <p>You will need to use the <code>width</code> system variable.</p>
                    <p>Here are a few clues:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>When y is 0, the index of any pixel will be x * 4.</li>
                        <li>The index of the very first pixel on the second row (y is 1) will be the index of the last 
                            pixel on the first row plus 4.
                        </li>
                        <li>The index of the first pixel on the third row (y is 2) will be the width of the image multiplied by two, multiplied by 4.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Help with the wipes</h3>
                    <p>It is recommended that you try a simple wipe first e.g. a horizontal wipe rather than a stripe wipe. You will need to work out 
                        the logic pattern that creates the wipe. For example, to create a horizontal wipe that moves left to right, remove / replace 
                        all pixels that have a given x coordinate e.g. all pixels with x === 0, then all pixels with x === 1 etc.
